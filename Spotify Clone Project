    <h1>Spotify defends handling of Joe Rogan controversy amid uproar</h1>
    <h2>As Spotify released an earnings report Wednesday underscoring the importance of podcasts to its business model, company officials said that they did not expect their subscriber numbers to be affected by the uproar over accusations that its most popular podcaster, Joe Rogan, had spread misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.  

        The company has been embroiled in controversy since Neil Young removed his music from the streaming platform last week, citing Rogan’s podcast and calling Spotify “the home of life-threatening COVID misinformation.” Joni Mitchell and several other artists and podcasters followed suit amid widespread calls on social media to boycott the company. Officials responded by publishing the service’s platform rules and saying that Spotify would begin adding content advisories to podcasts about the coronavirus. <br>
        
        But in an earnings call Wednesday afternoon, Daniel Ek, Spotify’s CEO and co-founder, said that the company’s expectations of premium users in the current quarter did not anticipate “churn” caused by the controversy over “The Joe Rogan Experience.”  <br>
        
        “In general, what I would say is, it’s too early to know what the impact may be,” Ek said in the call. “And usually when we’ve had controversies in the past, those are measured in months and not days. But I feel good about where we are in relation to that and obviously top line trends looks very healthy still.” <br>
        
        Ek defended the measures the streaming service is taking to combat misinformation, and spoke of “supporting greater expression while balancing it with the safety of our users.”</h2>

        Lost Sky <br> <hr>
        Over the edge
        Feel like I'm floating through the air
        The pain I felt is paid for, all is said and done, oh
        I am restricted, fixed upon the web
        I need to kick the habit that my mind is breathing in
        Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)
        Spent all my life holding all of it closely
        I played it innocent, a feel of discontent
        I'm finally facing it all, fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Burning the bridge that keeps us
        I'm here and I'm feeling fearless
        Exaggerated, that's what you assume
        The story's over now, I must conclude
        I am conflicted, watching where I step, still
        hanging in the balance, not the life I want to live
        I want to take it all, standing tall
        Fear outweighed the person you are (oh-ooh)
        Break out, I've got to see (break out, I've got to see)
        Spent all my life holding all of it closely
        I played it innocent, a feel of discontent
        I'm finally facing it all, fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless
        Fearless

            Where the moon and water meet
            Somewhere close to harmony
            When the world is sound asleep
            Something's gonna bring the change
            Journeys we are meant to take
            Something at the edge of space
            Calling us to fly away
            Don't you be afraid

                    We were young, posters on the wall
                    Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
                    We would stare at each other
                    'Cause we were always in trouble
                    And all the cool kids did their own thing
                    I was on the outside, always looking in
                    Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
                    They never really cared if I was in
                    We all need that someone
                    Who gets you like no one else
                    Right when you need it the most
                    We all need a soul to rely on
                    A shoulder to cry on
